# FILM SUCCESS ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide actionable insights that will help a newly established movie studio create the most profitable films. By analyzing various datasets, we aim to uncover trends in genre performance, budget efficiency, casting success, and release timing. Our goal is to offer concrete business recommendations to guide the studio's decisions on film production, resource allocation, and release strategies.

### Market Challenge: Strategic Film Production Decisions

The new movie studio faces the challenge of making strategic film production decisions to successfully enter a competitive market. 

With established companies already creating original content, the studio must identify the most profitable film types to achieve commercial success while addressing additional business challenges.

### Minimizing Risks

To mitigate losses, the studio must analyze key factors influencing financial outcomes:
Identify loss-prone movie production aspects.
Evaluate genre, budget, and casting impacts on success or failure

Additionally, with many large players already dominating the industry, the studio needs to differentiate itself by developing unique strategies that will enable them to stand out in a crowded market.
